# NN
In this section we provide information about the actual implementation of this project. For lack of a good data set we did not upload the results and admit that the implementation work would require further attention. One part is developed in Matlab and concerns the creation of the mathematical model of the wind turbine. Another part is an extract of the semantic segmentation for which we took inspiration from the following repository : https://github.com/Eromera/erfnet. This part is divided in : evaluations, inference, model structure and training.
